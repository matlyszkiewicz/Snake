/**
 * Snake game, which you can run on any customized desktop. After run, game screen makes blur
 * effect with stage always on top. The game target is to control the snake to eat apples. If
 * you get apples faster, your point stats are growing up faster. If you don't eat fruit,
 * you can get some negative points. Hurry up!!!
 *
 * How to play:
 * - LEFT and RIGHT arrow to direction changing;
 * - optional UP arrow to get max speed;
 *	
 * Game has implemented:
 * - collisions with any snake's segment and screen borders;
 * - blurred screen behind top layer;
 * - head shaking to imitate real snake motion;
 * - segment width depends on snake length;
 * - rendering apples between the screen borders except the actual snake's body;
 *
 * To do (development ideas):
 * - redesign game pop-ups;
 * - option screen;
 * - random walls to get the level more difficult;
 * - better apple design;
 * - overall optimization (lists, compare methods);
 * - reduce game library requirements;
 *
 * The game was created and tested on Windows 10 with 1920x1080px screen resolution.
 * Requirements (will be change):
 * Java SE 13
 * JavaFX 13
